# maykbot-ts

This bot includes all original [maykBot](https://github.com/libreMayk/maykBot) features (much faster), but is still in development. Basic usage already available.

## What's this?

This bot was created to help the **mayk** students get all the useful information **easily**, **quickly** and in **one, single place**.

The bot uses **slash commands** and **discord.js@13.8.1**.

### Installation

1. Install the necessary packages using `npm install`
2. Create the `.env` file and add the following (see `.env.example`):

```
TOKEN=sometoken
WEATHER_API_KEY=someapi
HSL_KEY=someotherapi
```

3. Enjoy!
